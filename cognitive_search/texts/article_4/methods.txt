Study design and population

A retrospective analysis of all adult subjects presenting to
the UC San Diego Health System (Jacobs and Hillcrest
Medical Centers) with confirmed polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)-positive testing for the SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic
acid from nasopharyngeal swabs was done. Demographic
data (Table 1) along with subjective and objective clini-
cal data (Table 2) were obtained from review of electronic
medical records (EMR), specifically encounters pertaining
to COVID-19 diagnosis. Self-reported sense of smell and
taste during time of illness were compared to premorbid
levels as dichotomous variables (loss of smell/taste vs nor-
mal/baseline). Specifically, we first retrospectively queried
the EMR for assessments on olfactory/gustatory function in
the encounters related to COVID-19. If self-reported olfac-
tory/gustatory function data were not available in the EMR,
we emailed or called patients to inquire about the status of
olfactory and gustatory function (“Have you had any smell
loss during this period of illness compared to before?” and
“Have you had any taste loss during this illness compared
to before?”). Chest radiograph findings were categorized
as “negative” if no findings were present and defined as

“positive” if presence of pulmonary infiltrates and/or pleu-
ral effusions were reported on final read by the attending
radiologist. This study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of University of California San Diego (IRB
#200485).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted with Stata 15.1 software
(StataCorp, College Station, TX). The primary outcome
was hospital admission. The secondary outcome was anos-
mia. Descriptive comparisons stratified by hospital admis-
sion and anosmia were conducted using a chi-square (χ 2)
test for categorical data and 2-way Student t test for con-
tinuous variables. The threshold for statistical significance
was set at p < 0.05. Multivariable logistic regression mod-
els were built to identify independent patient characteristics
associated with hospital admission as the dependent vari-
able. Logistic regression was also performed with anosmia
as the dependent variable. Inclusion criteria for factor inclu-
sion in multivariable models were set a priori and included
variables with the strongest magnitudes of association and
lowest probability of type I error on univariable logistic
regression. A maximum of 8 variables were included to
minimize potential model overfitting. Given the known co-
linear relationship between anosmia and dysgeusia, analy-
ses focused on anosmia alone. Similarly, analyses involving
decision to admit and decision to obtain a chest radiograph
focused on decision to admit; these variables were thus also
considered colinear. Although anosmia is not plausibly de-
pendent upon hospital admission, hospital admission was
kept in the multivariable model investigating associations
with anosmia as a marker for overall disease severity. Dis-
tribution medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs), odds
ratios (ORs; univariable logistic regression), adjusted odds
ratios (aORs; multivariable logistic regression), and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were reported with correspond-
ing probabilities of type-I error (p value).
