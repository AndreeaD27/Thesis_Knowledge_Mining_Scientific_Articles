The current study has identified a strong inverse association
between COVID-19â€“related anosmia and a critical branch
point in management of COVID-19: the decision to com-
mit to hospital admission. Patients admitted for COVID-19
were 10 times less likely to report anosmia. These find-
ings have important immediate practical applications to
the lay public as well as healthcare workers and health-
care systems looking to efficiently risk-stratify patients to
efficiently provide appropriate medical and nonmedical in-
terventions. The association between olfactory dysfunction
and clinical outcomes also carries important implications
for future investigations seeking to understand the abil-
ity of SARS-CoV-2 virus to overwhelm the host immune
response.
