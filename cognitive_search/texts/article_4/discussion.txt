Given the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases
that threaten to overwhelm healthcare systems, strategies
to risk stratify patients and early determination of disease
severity are urgently needed. Clinical characteristics asso-
ciated with critical illness and mortality from COVID-19
have been reported. A meta-analysis of clinical characteris-
tics of over 40,000 COVID-19 patients from Wuhan found
that patients with severe disease requiring intensive care
were more likely to have comorbidities of hypertension
(OR 2.36), respiratory system disease (OR 2.46), and car-
diovascular disease (OR 3.42) compared to patient not re-
quiring intensive care.16 Similar observations were made
in Italy, with hypertension and coronary artery disease be-
ing more prevalent in the severely ill COVID-19 patients.17

Of critically ill patients, risk factors for mortality included
increased age as a predictor of inpatient death (OR 1.1,
or 10% increase with each additional year of age)18 along
with markers of end-organ failure.17,18

In addition to investigating markers of critical illness, it
is important to consider characteristics that may help strat-
ify mild and moderate infections in early-stage COVID-19.
Here we present a novel clinical characteristic to help strat-
ify mild from moderate disease early in SARS-CoV-2 in-
fection. Patients reporting loss of smell were 10 times less
likely to be admitted for COVID-19 (OR 0.09; 95% CI,
0.01-0.74) compared to those without loss of smell. Fur-
thermore, anosmia/hyposmia was not associated with any
other measures typically related to the decision to admit,
suggesting that smell loss is truly an independent correlate
and may serve as a marker for milder manifestations of
COVID-19.

Our study’s findings are consistent with those of other
studies evaluating both inpatient and outpatient self-
reported olfactory dysfunction.9-12,14,15 Moein et al.11 re-
ported very high rates of measured olfactory dysfunction
(98%) on quantitative analysis of COVID-19 inpatients,
but only 25% showed complete anosmia and 35% self-
reported smell loss. This discrepancy between quantita-
tive and self-reported olfactory dysfunction is thought to
be related to a general unawareness or underreporting of
hyposmia.19 In the COVID-19 inpatient population, de-
creased awareness of chemosensory dysfunction may also
be influenced by the presence of more severe symptoms
such as respiratory distress. Despite this mismatch, we be-
lieve that our study’s findings differentiating the incidence
of smell loss between COVID-19 inpatients and outpatients
are valuable, because self-reported loss may more closely re-
flect profound or functional anosmia. Although the present
study did not specifically investigate degree of smell loss,
our previous study demonstrated that those who reported
smell loss typically suffered from its complete absence (0
out of 10 on a 0-10 scale).9 Although quantitative testing
is more sensitive in detecting olfactory dysfunction, self-
reporting of anosmia is relatively accurate (90%).19 Thus,
our study suggests that milder cases of COVID-19 may be
heralded by profound anosmia and higher self-reporting,
compared to the undetected or mild hyposmia associated
with moderate to severe COVID-19 cases. Further objec-
tive olfactory testing of both outpatient and inpatient co-
horts is required to clarify if quantitative differences in the

severity of olfactory dysfunction correlate with differences
in self-reported loss.

Assessment of smell may not only aid in the diagnosis of
COVID-19 infection during pretest screening, but also help
guide the posttest triaging of patients at all levels. Patients
with influenza-like symptoms concerning for COVID-19
infection but without anosmia should be more vigilant and
present earlier for evaluation and management. Although
in this particular study we did not ask subjects the timing
of smell loss onset in relationship to their other symptoms,
it has previously been shown that 33% to 60% of anosmic
COVID-19 patients reported smell loss either before or at
the same time of other symptoms.9,12,15 Of the self-reported
anosmic/hyposmic inpatients, 12 of 20 (60%) noted on-
set of smell loss prior to admission whereas 91% experi-
enced taste loss before admission, which we suspect may
be a profound anosmia impairing the odorant component
of flavor.15 Furthermore, epidemiologic studies found that
the average time from symptom onset to admission was 11
days.18 These data, taken together, suggest that profound
anosmia is a relatively early manifestation, whereas admis-
sion tends to occur relatively late in the disease process. Al-
though smell loss may not yet be manifested for all patients
at the time of their evaluation by a healthcare professional,
it still may be a useful early indicator in the majority of
patients. If the findings reported here remain consistent in
independent cohorts, anosmia/hyposmia could be consid-
ered as a clinical marker inversely related to disease severity.
As such, anosmia/hyposmia could be included in the clini-
cal assessment of disease severity and potentially aid in the
allocation of limited medical interventions. Just as Apgar
scores are an effective means to rapidly assess and triage
at-risk newborns,20 a future COVID-19 risk stratification
model may have a potential to improve resource allocation
and thereby save lives. Further research is needed to shed
light on clinical findings, upon which a model based on dis-
ease severity as shown in Figure 1 could be built. Although
the presented hypothetical model is not intended to substi-
tute for nuanced, patient-driven clinical decision making,
it may in the future serve as a general model to organize
decision making and risk stratification. Further study and
validation of all risk factors will evolve as the pandemic

progresses, but anosmia is emerging early as an important
clinical component of both COVID-19 diagnosis and po-
tentially outcome as well.

Beyond the immediate practical applications of anosmia
in addressing the pandemic, these findings potentially hint
at some characteristics of the pathophysiology of the infec-
tion. The site and dosage of the initial viral burden, along
with the effectiveness of the host immune response are all
potentially important variables in determining the spread
of the virus within an individual and ultimately the clinical
course of infection. A focused, small upper airway SARS-
CoV-2 viral load may be associated with a less fulminant
infection, decreasing the risk of overwhelming the host im-
mune response and subsequently, decreasing the risk of res-
piratory failure and hospitalization. This hypothesis, is in
essence the concept underlying live vaccinations, where low
dosage and distant site of inoculation generates an immune
response without provoking a severe infection.21

Similarly, anosmia may be a biomarker of the magnitude
of a host’s innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion. Although the mechanism of olfactory loss remains
unclear, radiographic imaging of a single case of isolated
anosmia and COVID-19 infection shows bilateral olfactory

cleft obstruction consistent with local inflammation.22 This
finding may be consistent with a greater local immune re-
sponse in the infection of patients presenting with anosmia
leading to an olfactory loss secondary to local infection and
edema and perhaps a milder overall clinical course. Indeed,
early, pre–peer review analyses of transcriptome data sug-
gest that the candidate receptors mediating cellular entry
of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), are ex-
pressed on olfactory epithelial support cells and not on
olfactory sensory neurons.23,24 Taken together, data show-
ing that SARS-CoV2 infects olfactory epithelia and causes
highly localized inflammation of the olfactory cleft suggest
that COVID-19–related olfactory dysfunction may result in
a conductive olfactory loss. Such a phenomenon would be
consistent with relatively rapid recovery of olfactory func-
tion with the resolution of viral infection in most patients,
consistent with previously reported clinical findings.9 In ad-
dition, these preliminary findings may be consistent with a
greater local immune response in patients presenting with
anosmia that may be indicative of a milder overall clinical
course. The inverse association of anosmia and sputum pro-
duction (OR 0.26) in the present study suggest that anos-
mic COVID-19 are less likely to have a symptom associated
with more severe lower airway inflammatory response. Al-
though these are tantalizing hypotheses of the underlying
pathophysiology currently only supported by piecemeal,
circumstantial molecular and clinical findings, significant
investigations into SARS-CoV-2 infection of airway mu-
cosa and the host immune response are required to begin
elucidating the underlying pathophysiology of the present
study’s clinical observations.

Additionally, further studies are warranted to validate
our clinical findings. Limitations include the use of self-
reported anosmia/hyposmia, particularly in those who re-
ported anosmia after being informed of COVID-19 diagno-
sis. This group is most susceptible to recall bias. Therefore,
findings herein and elsewhere based on self-reported anos-
mia after COVID-19 diagnosis should be validated in future
studies with quantitative testing of olfaction. In other dis-
ease processes there is discrepancy between self-reported
anosmia and measured anosmia.25 Furthermore, the design
of the questions posed to the subjects in this particular study
did not specifically assess the severity of smell loss, but only
if there was a loss of smell during their illness. Thus, in this
analysis, we cannot draw a distinction between hyposmia

and anosmia. However, our prior study did assess severity
of smell loss and those who reported smell loss typically
recalled complete functional anosmia.9 Our study has also
achieved a higher response rate from ambulatory COVID-
19 patients, some of whom were unable to be evaluated for
olfactory function due to their clinical status. As a result,
our data does not inform any potential relationship be-
tween anosmia and critical illness requiring intensive care
monitoring and intubation, or mortality. Notwithstanding
these limitations, in the absence of objective olfactory test-
ing, self-reported anosmia retains robust associations with
specific COVID-19–related disease features.

Our report is among the minority of reports focusing on
mild to moderate COVID-19 in which we attempt to eluci-
date clinical features to differentiate between patients with
mild disease who could be managed at home and “mod-
erately” sick patients who require admission and may be
at risk of further clinical deterioration. Prospective studies
are required to better determine the extent to which anos-
mia informs overall disease trajectory. Most early data have
focused on severely ill patients,16-18 but as the pandemic ap-
proaches plateau and eventually passes its peak, the clinical
characteristics of the moderately sick patient are important
to identify and administer early intervention before a sub-
set succumbs to critical, potentially fatal infection. Further
research is required to validate the association between ol-
factory function and hospitalization risk in patients with
COVID-19, which may include prospective, longitudinal,
and larger multi-institutional studies.
