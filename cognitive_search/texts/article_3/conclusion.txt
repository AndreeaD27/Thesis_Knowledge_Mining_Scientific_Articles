According to our results, the prevalence of gustatory and
olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients was almost

57.33% and 59.69%, respectively. This dysfunction
encompassed either complete or partial loss of these sen-
sations or any noticeable alteration in them. This preva-

lence may, in fact, be an underestimation of the true
prevalence because most included studies did not use vali-
dated tools/tests to detect OGD. The neurotropic nature of
SARS-CoV-2 is explained by the high neuronal and glial

cell expression of ACE-2 receptors, while direct damage to
glossal and olfactory receptors plays a pathogenic role as
well. Evaluating olfactory and gustatory functions both

objectively and subjectively will be helpful in primary
screening because PCR testing imposes significant con-
straints on medical resources.
