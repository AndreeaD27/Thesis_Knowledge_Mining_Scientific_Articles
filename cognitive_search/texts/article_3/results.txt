Study characteristics

A total of 25 studies were included in our systematic

review. All the data, including study details, percentage of
patients experiencing OGD, and the presence of other
neurological symptoms were extracted from the studies

and are presented in Table 1. The included studies’ total
sample size was 10,880, with individual studies’ sample
sizes ranging from a minimum of 55 to a maximum of
2883. In 12 out of 25 studies, the patients also presented
showing inclusion of studies.

with other neurological problems in addition to OGD,
headache being the most common. Only 17 studies that
gave the exact number of patients with anosmia and

hyposmia, ageusia, and dysgeusia were included in the
pooled analysis (forest plot), resulting in a total sample
size of 4149.

Prevalence of gustatory dysfunction

For evaluation of gustatory dysfunction, a total of 4149
patients included in 17 studies were identified. At least some

level of gustatory dysfunction was reported in 2676 patients.
Meta-analysis of the 17 included studies was performed using
revalence of olfactory dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.

a random-effects model, which demonstrated a prevalence of
57.33% gustatory dysfunction among the 4149 COVID-19

patients (95% CI, 44.585%e69.600%), as shown in
Figure 2. There was significant heterogeneity among the 17
studies, with an I

2
of p < 0.0001 (98.50%). Visual

inspection of the funnel plot (Supplementary File 1)

showed an asymmetric distribution of the studies,
suggesting the possibility of a publication bias. The Egger
test reported a p-value of 0.0526.

Prevalence of olfactory dysfunction

For evaluation of olfactory dysfunction, a total of 4149

patients included in 17 studies were identified. Some level of
olfactory dysfunction was reported in 2106 total patients.
Meta-analysis of the 17 included studies was performed using

a random-effects model, demonstrating a prevalence of
59.69% olfactory dysfunction among the 4149 COVID-19
patients (95% CI, 42.592%e75.656%), as shown in
Figure 3. There was significant heterogeneity among the
studies, with an I

2
of p < 0.0001 (99.17%). On visual

inspection of the funnel plot (Supplementary File 2), all
quadrants were seen to have a symmetric distribution,
showing non-significant publication bias. The Egger test re-
ported a p-value of 0.1849.

Additional analysis

Subgroup analysis (Figure 4A and B) was performed based
on the method used to detect olfactory dysfunction. Studies
that used validated instruments showed a pooled prevalence

of 61.27% (95% CI, 40.94%e79.72%) compared to 57.43%
(95% CI, 30.1%e82.49%) in studies that did not employ
validated tools. Sensitivity analysis (Figure 5) for gustatory

dysfunction, which was performed by removing studies with
a very small sample size (<100 participants), increased
pooled prevalence to 62.71% (95% CI, 47.33%e76.87%), up
from the original prevalence of 57.33%.
