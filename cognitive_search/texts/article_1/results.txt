A total of 417 patients completed the study. The mean age 
of patients was 36.9 ± 11.4  years (range 19–77). There 
were 263 females and 154 males. The following ethnicities 
composed the cohort: European (93.3%), South American 
(2.7%), Sub-Saharan African (2.2%), Black African (1.4%), 
Asian (0.2%), and North American (0.2%) (Table 1). The 
most prevalent comorbidities of patients were allergic rhi-
nitis, asthma, high blood pressure, and hypothyroidism 
(Fig. 1). The mean time between the onset of the infection 
and the evaluation was 9.2 ± 6.2 days. At the time of the 
study, 34.5% of patients were in the acute phase of the infec-
tion, whereas the rest of the patients did not yet have general 
symptoms. 

Clinical outcomes

The general symptoms of patients during the infection are 
described in Fig. 2. Cough, myalgia, loss of appetite, diar-
rhea, fever, headache, and asthenia were the most prevalent 
symptoms, accounting for more than 45% of patients. The 
otolaryngological symptoms most related to the infection 
are reported in Table 2.

Olfactory outcomes

A total of 357 patients (85.6%) had olfactory dysfunction 
related to the infection. Among them, 284 (79.6%) patients 
were anosmic and 73 (20.4%) were hyposmic. Phantosmia 
and parosmia concerned 12.6% and 32.4% of patients during 
the disease course, respectively. The olfactory dysfunction 
appeared before (11.8%), after (65.4%) or at the same time 
as the appearance of general or ENT symptoms (22.8%). 
Note that 9.4% of patients did not remember the time of 
onset of olfactory dysfunction and, therefore, were not con-
sidered for the percentage evaluation.

Considering the 247 patients with a clinically resolved 
infection (absence of general and ENT symptoms), the olfac-
tory dysfunction persisted after the resolution of other symp-
toms in 63.0% of cases. The mean time between the onset 
of the disease and the assessment of this group of patients 
was 9.77 ± 5.68 days.

The short-term olfaction recovery rate, which was 
assessed in 59 clinically cured patients, was 44.0%. The dif-
ferent recovery times of the olfactory function of patients 
who reported a recovery of the olfactory function are avail-
able in Fig. 3. In total, 72.6% of these patients recovered 
olfactory function within the first 8 days following the res-
olution of the disease. Among the patients who reported 
anosmia, then, excluding hyposmic patients, the olfactory

function recovered throughout the 8 first days following the 
resolution of the disease in 67.8% of cases (Fig. 3).

In the present study, 76 patients did not suffer from nasal 
obstruction or rhinorrhea (18.2%). Among them, 20.3% did 
not report olfactory dysfunction, whereas 66.2% and 13.5% 
suffered from anosmia and hyposmia, respectively.

The impact of olfactory dysfunction on patient QoL is 
reported in Table  3. Anosmic patients at the time of the 

evaluation had a significant lower sQOD-NS score com-
pared with hyposmic and normosmic individuals (p = 0.001; 
Kruskal–Wallis).

Gustatory outcomes

A total of 342 patients (88.8%) reported gustatory disorders, 
which was characterized by impairment of the following four

taste modalities: salty, sweet, bitter, and sour. Note that 32 
patients did not remember if they had gustatory dysfunction 
and, therefore, they were not considered for the assessment 
of the gustatory disorder prevalence. The gustatory dysfunc-
tion consisted of reduced/discontinued or distorted ability to 
taste flavors in 78.9% and 21.1% of patients, respectively.

Among the 43 patients without gustatory dysfunction, 19 
(44.2%) have no olfactory dysfunction, whereas 16 (37.2%) 
and 4 (9.3%) patients had anosmia or hyposmia.

The olfactory and gustatory disorders were constant and 
unchanged over the days in 72.8% of patients, whereas they 
fluctuated in 23.4% of patients. Among the patients who 

reported gustatory and olfactory disorders, 3.8% revealed 
that these disorders occurred during their rhinorrhea or nasal 
obstruction episodes.

Among the cured patients who had residual olfactory 
and/or gustatory dysfunction, 53.9% had isolated olfactory 
dysfunction, 22.5% had isolated gustatory dysfunction, and 
23.6% had both olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions.

Olfactory and gustatory outcome associations

There was no significant association between comorbidities 
and the development of olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions.

Olfactory dysfunction was not significantly associated with 
rhinorrhea or nasal obstruction. There was a significant 
positive association between olfactory and gustatory dys-
functions (p < 0.001). The statistical analysis identified a 
significant association between the fever and the anosmia 
(p = 0.014). The females would be proportionally more 
affected by hyposmia or anosmia compared with males 
(p < 0.001). Similar results were found for gustatory dys-
function (p = 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test).

Treatments of COVID‑19 patients

The following general treatments have been considered for 
patients with the COVID-19 infection: paracetamol (62.4%); 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (9.8%); nasal saline 
irrigations (9.6%); Chloroquine (7.9%); mucolytics (5.0%); 
and oral corticosteroids (1.4%, with concomitant antibiotics) 
(Fig. 4). The treatments that have been most used for olfac-
tory dysfunction were nasal saline irrigations (16.7%); nasal 
corticosteroids (8.1%), oral corticosteroids (2.5%), and oth-
ers (2.5%, e.g., vitamins, non-corticoid decongestants, and 
trace elements) (Fig. 4). Gustatory dysfunction was treated 
in 1.4% of patients: four patients received treatment, consist-
ing of l-carnitine or trace elements and vitamins. Telemedi-
cine has been used in 42.6% of patients for prescribing the 
treatment.
