Since the disease is new and the virus is most likely asso-
ciated with different mutations and clinical patterns, as of 
yet, there remain more questions than answers. This study 
is the first to identify both olfactory and gustatory dysfunc-
tions as significant symptoms in the clinical presentation of 
the European COVID-19 infection. Based on our results, it 
seems that infected patients may just present olfactory and 
gustatory dysfunctions without other significant complaints. 
The sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized by the 
international scientific community as important symptoms 
of the COVID-19 infection. Future epidemiological, clinical, 
and basic science studies must elucidate the mechanisms 
underlying the development of these symptoms in such a 
specific world population.
