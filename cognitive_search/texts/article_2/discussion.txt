COVID-19 infection with common symptoms such as fever 
and chills, cough and shortness of breath spread rapidly 
around the world [29, 30]. As the disease progressed and 
many people became infected with the virus, more symp-
toms such as gastrointestinal involvements, neurologic com-
plications and neuropsychiatric symptoms were reported 
[17, 19, 31]. Evidences of anosmia and dysgeusia have also 
been published in recent days [3, 12, 26]. Therefore, in this 
study, we reviewed the olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions 
of COVID-19.

Our review study showed that patients with COVID-
19 infection may have loss of taste or smell as the symp-
tom. Most studies (95.8%) have confirmed the symptoms 
of anosmia in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection [1–3, 

8–12, 14–28]. It is therefore likely that a surge in the spread 
of olfactory abnormalities happened during the epidemic 
of COVID-19 infection [1, 22]. Rather than injury to the 
structure of the receptors, the virus has been suggested to

cause some kind of inflammation in the olfactory nerves 
[3]. However, researchers’ findings suggest that the exact 
mechanism of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions requires 
further investigation [11, 15].

Anosmia has been anecdotally reported as a distinct 
symptom in patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-
19 in other studies [2, 3, 12, 16, 17]. However, existing 
cohort studies have not highlighted these symptoms, and the 
frequency and effectiveness of COVID-19 for these symp-
toms is not yet conclusive [3, 9]. The findings of Ghiasvand 
et al.’s study have implied that anosmia is a new symptom 
of COVID-19 infection and more research is needed to find 
how the virus affects patients’ olfactory system [28].

Anosmia is particularly seen in patients positive for the 
coronavirus who do not have any other clinical symptoms 
[3]. Gane et al., in a case report study, have reported a patient 
presenting with isolated sudden onset anosmia (ISOA) who 
went on to test positive for COVID-19 infection and did 
not develop any further symptoms such as respiratory or 
gastrointestinal symptoms that other patients may have 
[18]. Similarly, Eliezer et al. showed that the association of 
a sudden and complete olfactory function loss, without nasal 
obstruction in a patient with other symptoms, such as cough 
or fever, should alert the clinician to suspect SARS-CoV-2 
infection [27]

Review of current studies showed that, in addition of 
anosmia, evidences of ageusia and dysgeusia (parageusia) 
were also seen in patients with COVID-19 [2, 10, 19, 20, 
25]. The possibility that SARS-CoV-2 might cause olfactory 
and gustatory dysfunctions is certainly acceptable [26]. Cur-
rent studies indicated that hyposmia or anosmia and dysgeu-
sia may be an early symptom associated with the COVID-19 
infection [12, 19, 25].

A growing number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion report a sudden loss of smell or taste functions. It seems 
that anosmia and dysgeusia might be observed in COVID-
19 patients [25]. Based on a case control study results, the 
COVID-19-infected patients may just present olfactory and 
gustatory dysfunctions without other significant symptoms. 
The only anosmia or ageusia symptom needs to be recog-
nized by the infectious diseases specialists as an important 
symptom of the SARS-CoV-2 infection [10].

Other similar studies have confirmed the above-men-
tioned clinical manifestations [1, 2, 20]; for example, 
Machado in a review study concluded that because the exist-
ence of a relationship between post-infectious manifestations 
and COVID-19 is likely, it is highly recommended that those 
patients who experience complications such as smell and/
or taste loss, even as only symptoms, should be considered 
as potential SARS-CoV-2 infection carriers [2]. Moreover, 
Hjelmesæth et al., in a case report study have concluded that 
patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may have loss of taste 
or smell as the only symptom [20].
