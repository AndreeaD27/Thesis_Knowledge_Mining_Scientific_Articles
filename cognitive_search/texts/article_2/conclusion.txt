Although there have been few reports of definite change in 
smell and taste perception in patients with COVID-19, the 
findings of these studies raise the question whether SARS-
CoV-2 may cause olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions [2, 
13, 21, 22]. The results of our study support recent reports 
that SARS-CoV-2 may infect oral and nasal tissues and 
cause olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions. These findings 
may aid future research on the diagnosis, prevention and 
treatment of COVID-19 consequences.
