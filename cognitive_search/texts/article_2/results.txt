In a recent review, we studied the current evidences on 
olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions of COVID-19. For this 
purpose, 336 documents were identified and after removing

duplicate articles (n = 134), 370 records were screened. 
By applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 346 arti-
cles were removed and finally 24 articles were reviewed in 
full text. Articles in the selection process are shown by the 
PRISMA diagram (Fig. 1).

In this study, we finally reviewed 24 documents including 
21 articles (9 reports, 6 reviews, 5 letters to the editor, and 1 
cross-sectional study) and three clinical trials. The reviewed 
studies were conducted in the USA (n = 4), UK (n = 4), Iran 
(n = 4), Spain (n = 2), Italy (n = 2), China (n = 2), France 
(n = 2), Norway (n = 1), Switzerland (n = 1), Cuba (n = 1) 
and Denmark (n = 1). Review of current studies has shown 
that anosmia, hyposmia (microsmia), ageusia and dysgeusia 
(parageusia) are symptoms of COVID-19 disease that occurs 
in some patients (Table 1). According to the findings, anos-
mia was the most common symptom (n =  23) among other 

olfactory and gustatory manifestations of COVID-19. The 
frequency of identified symptoms is shown in Fig. 2.
