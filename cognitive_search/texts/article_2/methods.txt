We conducted a narrative review to determine whether SARS-
CoV-2 can affect the olfactory and gustatory system. Literature 
search was carried out in the databases of Scopus, PubMed, 
ScienceDirect, UpToDate, and Web of Science using the key-
words in combination on the following search strategy:

A. [Coronavirus] OR [COVID-19] OR [SARS-CoV-2] OR 
[Novel Coronavirus] OR [2019-nCoV]

B. [Olfactory] OR [Gustatory] OR [Anosmia] OR [Paros-
mia] OR [Hyposmia] OR [Phantosmia] OR [Ageusia] 
OR [Microsmia] OR [Dysgeusia] OR [Parageusia]

C. [A] AND [B]

Inclusion criteria were as follows: language (English-
written studies), type of study (original papers, abstracts, 
reports, reviews, letters to the editor, and clinical trials), and 
publication date (from December 2019 to April 2020). We 
excluded documents with inappropriate topics including old 
data that were not relevant to the main objective of the study. 
Also, non-English articles, ongoing manuscripts and papers 
addressing non-human studies, or discussing COVID-19 
symptoms in general, without reference to olfactory or gus-
tatory dysfunctions were excluded.

Finally, we screened the titles and abstracts of retrieved 
documents to identify studies meeting the inclusion criteria. 
The appropriate full-text articles were included and their 
results were discussed to make the final selection. After 
reading the full text of all eligible papers, the researchers 
made the final decision for each study.
