The study was conducted in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of Regensburg Univer-

sity Hospital in collaboration with the Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Hygiene of

Regensburg University Hospital. It was supported by a grant for COVID-19 related research of

the Bavarian State Ministry for Science and Art and conducted after approval by the ethics
committee of the University Regensburg (approval number 20–1766_4–101). The study was

performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and its later

amendments. Detailed information was provided to the patient in written form and their con-

sent was obtained in written form, too.

Patients

The database of the Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Hygiene of Regensburg University

Hospital was screened for patients who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse tran-

scription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between 01.03.2020 and 31.08.2020. During

that period 2472 positive PCR-tests of 1675 patients were conducted. Out of these patients, 797

were excluded because of fatal disease, age below 18 years, or missing personal data. Eight

months after their COVID-19 878 patients were invited to participate in this study by mail. In

the case of missing postal addresses, external hospitals and doctors’ offices have been contacted

for assistance.

The invitation letter contained the study information, forms for informed consent, and a

first questionnaire about patients’ preconditions, the course of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and

other details. Overall, 454 patients replied to this first questionnaire either using the attached

stamped and addressed envelope or through an online survey. To ensure a high level of partici-

pation psychophysical testing was not performed in the hospital but at home. Hence all

patients who replied positively to the invitation letter were sent the second letter containing

smell and taste tests, detailed instructions, and a second questionnaire. 316 patients responded

to the smell and taste test, of which 13 patients had to be excluded due to missing data.

Patients’ questionnaire

Patients were asked to answer questions on medical preconditions and the course of the

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, they self-rated their subjective olfactory and gustatory

function using a visual analogue score from 1 to 10 (1 having no smell/taste and 10 having no

impairment in smell/taste).

Psychophysical testing

Psychophysical testing consisted of validated and blinded tests for olfaction (NHANES Pocket

Smell Test, Sensonics, Haddon Heights, NJ, US) and gustation (Taste Strips Test, Burghart

Messtechnik, Holm, Germany). An attached instruction manual ensured correct self-adminis-

tration (Hintschich et al., 2020).

Olfactory function was assessed with the NHANES Pocket Smell Test. This scratch-and-

sniff suprathreshold olfactory test comprises eight familiar smells: chocolate, strawberry,

smoke, leather, soap, grape, onion, and natural gas. Six correct answers or more indicate nor-

mosmia, five and less correct answers indicate hyposmia/anosmia [18].

Gustatory function was tested using the Taste Strips Test. It consists of 16 impregnated filter

paper strips to test for four different concentrations of each taste quality (sweet 1: 0.4 g/ml

sucrose; sweet 2: 0.2 g/ml sucrose; sweet 3 0.1 g/ml sucrose; sweet 4: 0.05 g/ml sucrose), sour

(sour 1: 0.3 g/ml citric acid; sour 2: 0.165 g/ml citric acid; sour 3: 0.09 g/ml citric acid; sour 4:

0.05 g/ml citric acid), salty (salty 1: 0.25 g/ml sodium chloride; salty 2: 0.1 g/ml sodium chlo-

ride; salty 3: 0.04 g/ml sodium chloride; salty 4: 0.016 g/ml sodium chloride), and bitter (bitter

1: 0.006 g/ml quinine hydrochloride; bitter 2: 0.0024 g/ml quinine hydrochloride; bitter 3:

0.0009 g/ml quinine hydrochloride; bitter 4: 0.0004 g/ml quinine hydrochloride). Each strip

was packed in an individual paper bag, which was numbered in a pseudorandomized order

from 1 to 16, to allow a blinded self-administration at home. The attached instructions

described the self-administration of the test. Patients were instructed to rinse the mouth with

tap water and to observe a break of one minute after each strip. The test was presented as a

non-forced choice forced task: Additionally, to the answers “sweet”, “sour”, “salty”, and “bit-

ter” patients could choose “no answer”. This ensured the correct self-administration of the

Taste Strips Test and has been validated [19, 20] and successfully utilized [16] previously. The

correctly identified strips were summed up to the total Taste Strips score. Normogeusia was

defined as 9 or more correctly identified strips [21].

Taste Strips scores were compared to normative data by Welge-Lüssen et al. [16]. Without

prior screening, a total of 761 patients were psychophysically tested for their gustatory function

using the very same Taste Strips test in a non-forced choice paradigm. The distribution of age

(Welge-Lüssen et al.: mean age 35.6 years ± 19.3; this study: mean age 49.0 years ± 14.4) and
sex (Welge-Lüssen et al.: 61% female; this study: 55%) were comparable.

Statistics

Data was analyzed using SPSS Statistics software (version 26, IBM, Armonk, NY, US). Graphs

were illustrated using Prism software (version 9, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

Unless stated differently values are given as mean ± standard deviation (SD). p<0.05 was con-
sidered as statistically significant. Continuous data were analyzed for statistical significance

using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests. The corresponding homogeneity of variance was

assessed using Levene’s test. Proportions between cohorts was calculated using the Z-test. Cat-

egorical data was compared between groups using Fisher’s exact test. Correlations were deter-

mined using Pearson’s or phi correlation.
