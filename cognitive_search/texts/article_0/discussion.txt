To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to psychophysically assess gustation post-

COVID-19. Additionally, it is the largest study to test both olfactory and gustatory function

using validated and blinded psychophysical tests in the long-term after COVID-19. In our

cohort around 70% of the population stated retrospectively to have experienced hyposmia and

hypogeusia, respectively. Eight months later around 25% still reported chemosensory impair-

ments. This magnitude is in line with the reports on persisting subjective chemosensory disor-

ders months after COVID-19 [8–12, 17].

Based on the psychophysical smell test 18% patients were classified as hyposmic. This is not

only lower than subjective reports from the present and other studies, but also lower than

prior test results: Boscolo-Rizzo et al. found an olfactory impairment in 60% when performing

the comprehensive UPSIT six months after COVID-19 [14]. The different follow-up period as

well as the lower prevalence of psychophysically confirmed hyposmia in our study can possibly

be explained through the sensitivity of the utilized test. Previously, a limited test sensitivity of

60% has been identified for the NHANES Pocket Smell Test [18]. Hence, the prevalence of

hyposmia could be underestimated in the present study. The discrepancies between the vari-

ous studies may also point towards selection bias in terms of the inclusion of participants.

In contrast, gustatory testing revealed a high prevalence of taste disorders: 32% of our

cohort of more than 300 patients were tested hypogeusic (Fig 1). Importantly, the prevalence

of hypogeusia after COVID-19 was significantly higher than in the general population: In a

healthy sample of 761 patients only 5% were tested hypogeusic using the same Taste Strips

Test [16]. Other studies found taste impairment in 15 to 20% of the pre-COVID population

[22–24]. Scores for all individual taste qualities (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) were significantly

impaired compared to the results from Welge-Lüssen et al. (all p<0.001; Table 1). Gustatory
testing showed a lower mean Taste Strips score for sour (1.6±1.0) compared to the three other
taste qualities (sweet: 3.0±1.1; salty: 2.4±1.1; bitter: 2.7±1.3). It is notable that the subjects also
displayed impaired sensitivity to the other taste qualities as well, relative to the normative data

of Welge-Lüssen et al. (sour 2.5; sweet 3.7; salty: 3.4; bitter: 3.3). This suggests that gustatory

impairment in post-COVID-19 probably does not specifically affect individual taste qualities.

Interestingly, we found a difference in the prevalence of hypogeusia dependent on the

severity of COVID-19. In patients experiencing a mild course hypogeusia could be diagnosed

in 28%. However, after intensive care hospitalization due to COVID-19 patients were hypo-

geusic in even 51%. This finding contrasts with prior publications on gustatory function dur-

ing acute COVID-19: Various studies found gustatory as well as olfactory dysfunction to be

less frequent in patients receiving intensive care hospitalization compared to patients with a

mild course of COVID-19 [25–27]. The high prevalence of gustatory dysfunction after inten-

sive care hospitalization could be explained differently. A higher viral load in severe COVID-

19 could exacerbate a potential SARS-CoV-2-associated direct damage of the gustatory path-

way. Some drugs are known for their long-lasting side effects on taste [28, 29]. And the

reduced general condition after severe COVID-19 [30] as well as a reduced neurological out-

come after acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) could also further impair gustation

[31].

In contrast to olfactory dysfunction [6, 7, 12, 14] the prevalence of psychophysically con-

firmed hypogeusia might be higher post-COVID-19 than during the acute infection. Three

studies assessed taste during acute COVID-19 using the Taste Strips test in a forced-choice

paradigm. They found hypogeusia in only 12% to 26% [7, 32, 33]. While the discrepancy

between the present results and previous reports may be explained by the test modes (forced-

choice testing vs. non-forced choice testing), still the present results obtained eight months

after the infection show that taste function does not recover or may even deteriorate in the

months following COVID-19. Hence, chronic gustatory dysfunction in more than 30% of the

subjects may reflects direct damage of taste buds, indirect inflammatory effects on the gusta-

tory pathway [3], or changes in central processing of taste.

For chronic non-COVID-19 hyposmia a secondary gustatory impairment has been sug-

gested [34–37]. As the processing of chemical information from olfaction, gustation, and tri-

geminal input uses overlapping brain regions and amplifies each other, a secondary

hypogeusia could be explained through reduced amplification of gustation on a central ner-

vous level [38–40]. Prolonged olfactory dysfunction after COVID-19 may also be associated

with secondary hypogeusia as it has been shown for pre-COVID hyposmia of various etiolo-

gies [37]. Similarly, Huart et al. found significantly decreased gustation in hyposmic COVID-

19 patients two weeks after COVID-19 [41].

Two more results of this study support this hypothesis: Firstly, gustatory dysfunction signif-

icantly affects any of the four tested qualities. This is in accordance with previous findings of

Gudziol et al., showing that anosmic patients have higher thresholds for the gustatory qualities

sweet, sour, salty, and bitter [34]. Secondly, in this study psychophysically confirmed hypogeu-

sia was significantly associated with tested hyposmia. Also, the score of NHANES Pocket Smell

Test and the Taste Strips Tests correlated significantly with each other. This could not be

observed in acute COVID-19 [42] and suggests that a chronic post-COVID-19 hyposmia

might secondarily impair gustatory function.
