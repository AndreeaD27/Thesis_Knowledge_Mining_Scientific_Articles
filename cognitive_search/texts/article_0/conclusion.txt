This study confirmed that olfactory dysfunction can be a chronic symptom even eight months

after COVID-19. Interestingly, hypogeusia, a rare symptom during the acute infection, has

been psychophysically confirmed in 32% of the study population. This must be seen as a fre-

quent symptom of post-COVID-19 condition and might be partly due to a decreased central

nervous amplification.
