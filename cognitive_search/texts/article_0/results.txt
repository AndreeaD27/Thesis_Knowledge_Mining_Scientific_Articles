303 patients (mean age 49.0 years ± 14.4) who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by
RT-PCR eight months before were included in this study. 167 patients (55%) were female, and

136 patients (45%) were male.

Subjective rating

70% and 74% of the patients stated retrospectively to have suffered an olfactory and a gustatory

impairment, respectively, during the acute phase of COVID-19. Eight months later these fig-

ures were at 28% and 24%. In the visual analogue score (VAS) patients self-rated their present

olfactory function as 7.9±2.1 and gustatory function as 8.2±1.8. Forty percent indicated the
presence of dysgeusia during COVID-19 and 10% at the time of the follow-up.

Smell test

The mean score of the NHANES Pocket Smell Test was 6.4±1.3 with 54 patients (18%) scoring
in the hyposmic range (5 or less correct answers), and 249 patients (82%) scoring in the range

of normosmia (Fig 1). There was a weak but significant negative correlation between age and

smell score (r = -0.19, p<0.001).

Taste test

The mean Taste Strips score was 9.7±3.4. 97 patients (32%) scored in the range of hypogeusia
(Fig 2); 206 patients (68%) scored in the normogeusic range. Table 1 shows the percentage of

correct answers of the single Taste Strips.

More women than men were normogeusic (80% vs. 54%; p = 0.001). Women scored also
higher than men (10.5±3.0 vs. 8.6±3.4; p<0.001). Interestingly, patients who were hospitalized
on intensive care units were significantly more often hypogeusic (51% vs. 28%; p = 0.003) and
also scored significantly lower in gustatory testing than those without intensive care hospitali-

zation (8.3±3.5 vs. 10.0±3.3; p = 0.002). Allergies (p = 0.025) and a prior radiotherapy of the
head and neck region (p = 0.002) had a significant influence on gustation. Other potential

covariates as smoking, prior surgery of the paranasal sinuses, the nasal septum/inferior turbi-

nates, or the brain, chronic rhinosinusitis, neurological diseases, or a prior traumatic brain

injury had no significant influence on gustatory function (p>0.05).

Correlation between smell and taste tests

A highly significant association between tested hyposmia and tested hypogeusia was found (φ
= 0.24; p<0.001). Correspondingly, a weak, but significant correlation could be demonstrated
between the scores of the Pocket Smell Test and the Taste Strips (r = 0.32; p<0.001).

Correlation between subjective ratings and psychophysical results

Self-rated olfactory function (VAS score) correlated moderately with the score of the Pocket

Smell Test (r = 0.42, p<0.001). However, between self-rated taste function and taste strips
score no such correlation could be observed (r = 0.09, p = 0.14).
